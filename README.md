This repository focuses on using machine learning algorithms to classify messages and emails as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam.'

1) spam_ham_1: Utilizes supervised learning techniques with labeled data to train and evaluate models.
  
2) spam_ham_2: Explores unsupervised learning approaches, working with unlabeled data to identify patterns and classify messages effectively
